<p><img src="../Images/quidley.jpg" class="exhibitpicA" alt="Peter Quidley. As Time Goes By. Oil on panel. 24 x 36 inches. 2006." />Lyman Allyn Art Museum announces a new exhibition, The Subject is Light: The Henry and Sharon Martin Collection of Contemporary Realist Paintings, opening March 19, 2011 and on view through August 21, 2011.  The exhibition has been organized by the Cape Cod Museum of Art and curated by CCMoA Director Elizabeth Ives Hunter, Ph.D.<p><br />

<p>Henry and Sharon Martin, who began to collect art over 30 years ago, have built what is arguably the strongest Hudson River School luminist collection in private hands today. Within the last ten years, they have expanded their focus on the living artists of Cape Cod – concentrating on work that meets their exacting criteria.  Henry Martin says, "When we've looked at the same picture 100 times, we want to look at it for the 101st time and still see something new". The Martins believe that representational art is re-emerging as an important element in American art and are focused on excellence in all areas. Their goal is to acquire the best works by the best artists of this region.<p><br />

<p>The Subject is Light: The Henry and Sharon Martin Collection of Contemporary Realist Paintings includes work by Jacob Collins, William R. Davis, Donald Demers, Robert Douglas Hunter, Joseph McGurl, Anne Packard, Pam Pindell, Peter Quidley and Matthew Schulz.<p><br />

<p>This exhibition is accompanied by a full-color catalog available at the museum bookstore and online at www.lymanallyn.org.<p><br />

<p><img src="../Images/mcgurl.jpg" class="exhibitpicA" alt="Joseph McGurl. Offshore. Oil on canvas. 24 x 48 inches. 2008." />Elizabeth Ives Hunter joined the Cape Cod Museum of Art in July 2003 as Exhibitions Curator.  She was later appointed Executive Director of the museum.  She has taught courses on Provincetown Painters 1883-1960 at the Academy for Life Long Learning and at the Weny Education Center at the Cape Cod Museum of Art.  Mrs. Hunter lives in Walpole, Massachusetts with her husband, painter Robert Douglas Hunter, and their children.<p><br />

<p>The Lyman Allyn Art Museum's mission is to respond and to appeal to the regional community.  In that spirit, the museum has planned an exciting schedule of programs to accompany this exhibition.  The programs are designed to engage people of all ages. <p><br />
